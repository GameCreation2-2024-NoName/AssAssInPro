This simple demo tests some of the Highlight Plus 2D effects:

- The icons and the blue potion will be highlighted when mouse is over
- Icons will show the see-through effect behind the wall when mouse is over them over

IMPORTANT: this demo scene has been created for the old input system. If you're using the New Input System, it won't work (the asset works with the new input system though).
You can change the "Active Input Handling" to "Both" in Project Settings / Player to support the old and the new input systems.
